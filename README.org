 It is sometimes hard to remember what bindings you have set without having to open up your =init= file and checking yourself.

 This package parses your Emacs init file for =use-package= or =global-set-key= calls and summarises the bindings it detects on a package-by-package basis.

 This is different from [[https://github.com/danil/ido-describe-bindings][ido-describe-bindings]] and [[https://github.com/fgallina/region-bindings-mode][region-bindings-mode]] in the sense that the former parses all bindings without much context to what the user has set themselves, and the latter is more a tool for switching bindings in certain contexts.

 The package provides a toggleable side-buffer showing all relevant bindings, and it also makes use of [[https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-quotes.el][omni-quotes.el]], such that when =omni-quotes-mode= is enabled, a random binding is shown in the minibuffer when the user idle.

 To make the displayed list of bindings more specific to the buffer, a minor-mode =remind-bindings-specific-mode= can be enabled.

** Installation

   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package remind-bindings
       :hook (after-init . remind-bindings-initialise)
       :custom (remind-bindings-initfile (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/init.el"))
       :bind (("C-c C-d" . 'remind-bindings-toggle-buffer)   ;; toggle buffer
              ("C-c M-d" . 'remind-bindings-specific-mode))) ;; buffer-specific only
   #+end_src

** Customization

 The default format in which shortcuts are displayed is:

 #+begin_src shell
 [packagename] key1 → func1 | key2 → func2 | key3 → func3
 #+end_src


 All text separators and decoration can be customised by modifying:

 #+begin_src elisp
   (setq remind-bindings-format-packbincom "[%s] %s")
   (setq remind-bindings-format-bincom "%s → %s")
   (setq remind-bindings-format-bindingsep " | ")
 #+end_src
